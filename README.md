# Features Implemented

## Features

1. Landing page:

- The landing page contains the overview of the website about how we intend the users to use this website.

2. Sign in and sign up page :

- All the checks have been made on the frontend side for email and password. For example, we have defined the password pattern that the user must enter while signing up.

3. Home Page :

- Once the user is signed in, a user id is generated, saved in Local Storage, which helps maintain session activity. This user id is verified every time the user visits any page.
  A Sliding Banner is implemented, using JS and CSS.
  Once logged in, the browser would prompt for the users location, which will be displayed in the Navigation Bar.
  It also includes a Search Bar used to search for various restaurants.
  Once the restaurant is finalized by the user, they are transfered to that particular restaurant's page.

4. Restaurant Page :

- Restaurant Page contains various details regarding that restaurat, like delivery time, location, rating, restaurant type and the offers available at the moment. Below the restaurant banner, the user can view various dishes, and add them to the cart, on the right. After finalising the dishes the user can place the order and view its details on the Order Details Page.

5. Order Details Page :

- User can view the current order, all the dish details, along with the Bill Details. And there is also an option for rating the order, which then gets added to the restaurant's overall rating.

6. Past Order Page :

- User can view their accounts past order history, with the Total Bill and the exact date and time of the order, the restaurant's name.

7. Account Page :

- The account details of the user can be viewed and updated. The user can also change their current password, using the old password.

8. Restaurant Owner page :
